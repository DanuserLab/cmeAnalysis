![Alt Text](img/cmeAnalysis.jpg?raw=true)

cmeAnalysis (clathrin-mediated endocytosis analysis) is a MATLAB software package for the quantification of clathrin-coated pit dynamics from fluorescence time-lapse data. The functionalities provided include highly sensitive detection, tracking (based on u-track), master/slave detection for multi-channel data, intensity-based classification of coated structures, and lifetime analysis. Additionally, the package includes a graphical user interface for inspection of analysis results from individual movies.
The download includes a user guide, and a test data set is available separately.

----------------------
“Disassembly asymmetry score classification” (DASC), is based on the new method developed in the article, “DASC, a sensitive classifier for measuring discrete early stages in clathrin-mediated endocytosis”, by Wang X. et. al. 2020. 
DASC is built upon and embedded in cmeAnalysis.
